# Compile sources
Run the proxy from binary source. We recommend using [Docker compose](docker_compose_setup.md)


## Prerequisites
- IGDB client and secret you do not need an auth token ([Click here to create your client and secret](https://api-docs.igdb.com/#getting-started))
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- Go 1.24.1
## Setup
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:PhoebeSoftware/exhibition-proxy.git
```

2. Go into the directory
```bash
cd exhibition-proxy/src
```

3. Run the program to generate config file
```bash
go run .

Failed to launch: Please fill in the IGDB client and secret
```
4. Configure the settings found in exhibition-proxy/data/proxy-settings.json (one directory back)
```json
{
  "igdb_settings": {
    "igdb_client": "put your IGDB client here",
    "igdb_secret": "put your IGDB secret here",
    "igdb_auth": "ignore this field it will be autogenerated",
    "expires_at": "dont worry about this field either"
  },
  "port": 12345
}
```
5. Run the program again 
```bash
cd ../src
go run .
