# Docker compose setup (Recommended)
Run the proxy in a docker container using Docker compose, ideal for servers.


## Prerequisites
- IGDB client and secret you do not need an auth token ([Click here to create your client and secret](https://api-docs.igdb.com/#getting-started))
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Setup

1. Pull the image
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/phoebesoftware/exhibition-proxy:latest
```
2. Create a docker-compose.yml in the directory you want
```yaml
# Example docker-compose.yml
services:
  exhibition-proxy:
    image: "ghcr.io/phoebesoftware/exhibition-proxy:latest"
    ports:
      - "12345:12345"
    # Its very useful to bind the data folder because the proxy-settings.yml is in /usr/local/app/data
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    environment:
      # Default is /data but you can change it here if you desire
      # Note this changes the path in your docker container not on the root
      - DATA_PATH=/data
```
3. Run the docker-compose.yml to generate the config
```bash
docker compose up
```
NOTE: Supposed to crash with this message:
```bash
Config file path: data/proxy-settings.json
Failed to launch: Please fill in the IGDB client and secret
```
4. Configure the settings found in ./data/proxy-settings.json
```json
{
  "igdb_settings": {
    "igdb_client": "put your IGDB client here",
    "igdb_secret": "put your IGDB secret here",
    "igdb_auth": "ignore this field it will be autogenerated",
    "expires_at": "dont worry about this field either"
  },
  "port": 12345
}
```
5. Run the docker compose.yml in the same directory to start the server
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
6. Done. Congratulations!!!
