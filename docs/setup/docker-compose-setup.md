# Docker compose setup

1. Pull the image
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/phoebesoftware/exhibition-proxy:latest
```
2. Create a docker-compose.yml in the directory you want
```yaml
# Example docker-compose.yml
services:
  ghcr.io/phoebesoftware/exhibition-proxy:latest:
    image: "exhibition-proxy"
    ports:
      - "12345:12345"
    # Its very useful to bind the data folder because the proxy-settings.yml is in /usr/local/app/data
    volumes:
      - ./data:/usr/local/app/data
    # If you want to change the directory where the data is stored you can do so via env
    environment:
      - DATA_PATH=/usr/local/app/data
```
3. Run the docker compose.yml in the same directory to generate the config
```bash
docker compose up
```
NOTE: Supposed to crash with this message:
```bash
Failed to launch: Please fill in the IGDB client and secret
Config file path: data/proxy-settings.json
```
4. Update the proxy-settings.yml
```json
{
  "igdb_settings": {
    "igdb_client": "put your IGDB client here",
    "igdb_secret": "put your IGDB secret here",
    "igdb_auth": "ignore this field it will be autogenerated",
    "expires_at": "dont worry about this field either"
  },
  "port": 12345
}
```
7. Run the docker compose.yml in the same directory to start the server
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
8. Done. Congratulations!!!
