# Build the docker image yourself (Docker Compose)

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PhoebeSoftware/exhibition-proxy
```
2. Go into the directory
```bash
cd exhibition-proxy
```
3. Build docker image
```bash
docker build --tag 'exhibition-proxy' .
```
4. Create a docker-compose.yml in the directory you want
```yaml
# Example docker-compose.yml
services:
  exhibition-proxy:
    image: "exhibition-proxy"
    ports:
      - "12345:12345"
    # Its very useful to bind the data folder because the proxy-settings.yml is in /usr/local/app/data
    volumes:
      - ./data:/usr/local/app/data
```
5. Run the docker compose.yml in the same directory to generate the config
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
6. Update the proxy-settings.yml
```json
{
  "igdb_settings": {
    "igdb_client": "put your IGDB client here",
    "igdb_secret": "put your IGDB secret here",
    "igdb_auth": "ignore this field it will be autogenerated",
    "expires_at": "dont worry about this field either"
  },
  "port": 12345
}
```
7. Run the docker compose.yml in the same directory to start the server
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
8. Done. Congratulations!!!
